# System configuration

The following steps are necessary to use pymistral.

## Environment 
Create a new conda environment using the pymistral.yml file. This has to be done on the supercomputer when using pymistral on an HPC system or locally for a standalone configuration.

`conda env create -f pymistral.yml`

If the environment already exists and needs to be updated, use:
```
source activate pymistral
conda env update -f=pymistral.yml
```


## Script to start jupyterlab on HPC
This part is only necessary when jupyterlab and pymistral is used on a remote HPC system.

### pymistral_preload
Place the pymistral_preload file into your home directory on mistral and change the conda environment name if necessary.

### start-pymistral.sh
Adjust the start-pymistral.sh script with your username and project number.

Change SJ_INCFILE if pymistral_preload has been renamed.
